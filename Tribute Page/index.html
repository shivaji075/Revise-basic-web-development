      <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, affectionately called as Netaji, was one of the most prominent leaders of Indian freedom struggle.
      Though Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru have garnered much of the credit for successful culmination of Indian freedom
      struggle, the contribution of Subash Chandra Bose is no less. He has been denied his rightful place in the annals of
      Indian history. He founded Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj) to overthrow British Empire from India and came to
      acquire legendary status among Indian masses.
      Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
      <br><br>
      Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa. His father Janaki Nath Bose was a famous lawyer and
      his mother Prabhavati Devi was a pious and religious lady. Subhas Chandra Bose was the ninth child among fourteen
      siblings. Subhas Chandra Bose was a brilliant student right from the childhood. He topped the matriculation examination
      of Calcutta province and graduated with a First Class in Philosophy from the Scottish Churches College in Calcutta. He
      was strongly influenced by Swami Vivekananda's teachings and was known for his patriotic zeal as a student. To fulfill
      his parents wishes he went to England in 1919 to compete for Indian Civil Services. In England he appeared for the
      Indian Civil Service competitive examination in 1920, and came out fourth in order of merit. However, Subhas Chandra
      Bose was deeply disturbed by the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre, and left his Civil Services apprenticeship midway to return
      to India in 1921.
      <br><br>
      After returning to India Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose came under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi and joined the Indian
      National Congress. On Gandhiji's instructions, he started working under Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, whom he later
      acknowledged his political guru. Soon he showed his leadership mettle and gained his way up in the Congress' hierarchy.
      In 1928 the Motilal Nehru Committee appointed by the Congress declared in favour of Domination Status, but Subhas
      Chandra Bose along with Jawaharlal Nehru opposed it, and both asserted that they would be satisfied with nothing short
      of complete independence for India. Subhas also announced the formation of the Independence League. Subhas Chandra Bose
      was jailed during Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. He was released in 1931 after Gandhi-Irwin pact was signed. He
      protested against the Gandhi-Irwin pact and opposed the suspension of Civil Disobedience movement specially when Bhagat
      Singh and his associates were hanged.
      <br><br>
      Subash Chandra Bose was soon arrested again under the infamous Bengal Regulation. After an year he was released on
      medical grounds and was banished from India to Europe. He took steps to establish centres in different European capitals
      with a view to promoting politico-cultural contacts between India and Europe. Defying the ban on his entry to India,
      Subash Chandra Bose returned to India and was again arrested and jailed for a year. After the General Elections of 1937,
      Congress came to power in seven states and Subash Chandra Bose was released. Shortly afterwards he was elected President
      of the Haripura Congress Session in 1938. During his term as Congress President, he talked of planning in concrete
      terms, and set up a National planning Committee in October that year. At the end of his first term, the presidential
      election to the Tripuri Congress session took place early 1939. Subhas Chandra Bose was re-elected, defeating Dr.
      Pattabhi Sitaramayya who had been backed by Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress Working Committee. Clouds of World War II
      were on the horizon and he brought a resolution to give the British six months to hand India over to the Indians,
      failing which there would be a revolt. There was much opposition to his rigid stand, and he resigned from the post of
      president and formed a progressive group known as the Forward Block.
      <br><br>
      Subhas Chandra Bose now started a mass movement against utilizing Indian resources and men for the great war. There was
      a tremendous response to his call and he was put under house arrest in Calcutta. In January 1941, Subhas Chandra Bose
      disappeared from his home in Calcutta and reached Germany via Afghanistan. Working on the maxim that "an enemy's enemy
      is a friend", he sought cooperation of Germany and Japan against British Empire. In January 1942, he began his regular
      broadcasts from Radio Berlin, which aroused tremendous enthusiasm in India. In July 1943, he arrived in Singapore from
      Germany. In Singapore he took over the reins of the Indian Independence Movement in East Asia from Rash Behari Bose and
      organised the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) comprising mainly of Indian prisoners of war. He was hailed as
      Netaji by the Army as well as by the Indian civilian population in East Asia. Azad Hind Fauj proceeded towards India to
      liberate it from British rule. Enroute it lliberated Andeman and Nicobar Islands. The I.N.A. Head quarters was shifted
      to Rangoon in January 1944. Azad Hind Fauj crossed the Burma Border, and stood on Indian soil on March 18 ,1944.
      <br><br>
      However, defeat of Japan and Germany in the Second World War forced INA to retreat and it could not achieve its
      objective. Subhas Chandra Bose was reportedly killed in an air crash over Taipeh, Taiwan (Formosa) on August 18, 1945.
      Though it is widely believed that he was still alive after the air crash not much information could be found about him.</p><br>
